@month is an array of month names
@R is an array of 12 month lengths(31,28,31,30,31,30,31,31,30,31,30,31);
@mon is an array of digits 0 - 11.

remember/store the incrementing value for $mon in a variableB 

Subtract the current day of the month from 73(remainder(rem));

store the remainder in a variable rem;

less $R[$mon]+1 from rem = (valueX);

if valueX > 31 =>less $R[$mon]+2 from valueX

print/read the result of month[variableB] valueX to give +73 days local
